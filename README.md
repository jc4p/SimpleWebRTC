This is a fork of SimpleWebRTC for my specialized internal use of it.

Our use-case:

* One presenter, sharing both their audio/video and screen.
* N viewers, able to view the presenter but not talk or share video.
* Real time chat, currently powered by Pusher.js, soon to be powered by just using the socket.io server that's already set up for the other requirements of this.
